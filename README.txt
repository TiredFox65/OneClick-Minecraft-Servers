## Troubleshooting Guide

### If Errors Occur Without Proper Failure Analysis, Check the Following:

1. **Is the Correct Version of Java Installed?**
   - Check the "libs\java" folder for the required installers.

2. **Could It Be a Firewall Issue?**
   - Ensure that your firewall isn’t blocking the necessary connections.

3. **Have You Tried Restarting?**
   - Close "Main.bat" and reopen it to see if the issue resolves.

4. **Do You Have at Least 4GB of Available RAM?**
   - Ensure you meet the minimum RAM requirements for smooth operation.

### If You Are Having Trouble Joining the Server, Check the Following:

1. **Have You Installed All the Required Mods?**
   - Ensure all client-side and server-side mods are correctly installed.

2. **Are Client-Side Mods on the Server?**
   - Client-side mods should not be placed in the server directory. Remove them if present.

- 127.0.0.1
- 127.0.0.1:25565
- localhost:25565
- <YourIPAddress>:25565

### Want to Play Online, Not Just LAN?

#### **Option 1: Share Your IP Address**
1. Share your **IP address** with your friends (not recommended unless you trust them).
2. Ensure your firewall allows access to the server (you may need to configure your firewall).

#### **Option 2: Use "Hamachi" to Create a VPN Connection**
1. Download and install **Hamachi** (third-party software) to create a virtual private network.
2. Have your friends join your network/session via Hamachi.

#### **Option 3: Host a Server with a Domain**
1. Purchase a domain online (many providers offer this service).
2. Edit the "server.properties" file (located in the server folder) with the correct domain information.
3. Set up your domain to point to your server (search for an online tutorial if needed).

### Notes:
- Always back up your server files before making significant changes.
- Consult the official Minecraft documentation or mod guides for additional help with specific mods or configurations.
